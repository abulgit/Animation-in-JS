This is a simple particle explosion animation project using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas.
I Create this project on the Task of MLH Global Hack Week(GHW).
## Description

The animation displays a canvas with the text "Click anywhere in the box" at the center. When you click on the canvas, a burst of colorful particles will explode from the clicked position.
## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:


git clone [https://github.com/your-username/particle-explosion-animation.git]


2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Click anywhere inside the canvas to trigger the particle explosion animation.

## Customization

You can customize the animation by adjusting the following parameters in the `animation.js` file:

- `numParticles`: The number of particles in the explosion.
